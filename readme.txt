-Startup-
Make sure that items.txt, rooms.txt, wallItems.txt and all required images in itemImages and playerImages are present.
Run the main method inside MainWindow.java.

You will then have the option to start a server, a client or a single player game.
The first two options are for playing a multiplayer game.
To create a client connection successfully you must first have created a server, or have had a friend create one.
The option to start a multiplayer game will appear once you have created a client connection successfully.
Starting a singleplayer game after a client connection has been successfully made will disconnect the client connection.
Server messages will be delivered by the console, only the server host will see these.
